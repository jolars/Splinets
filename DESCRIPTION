Title: Algebra and calculus of functional splines; spline support sets; orthogonal spline bases
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Xijia Liu, Krzysztof Podgórski
Maintainer: Krzysztof Podgórski <krys.podgorski@gmail.com>
Description: The package represents efficiently splines through the local Taylor representation accounting also for their support sets; generates B-splines and orthogonal bases of splines that reside on small total support sets, such bases are referred to as 'splinets'; builds arbitrary splines; generates random splines; performs all fundamental algebraic and calculus operations on splines; performs optimal, in the least square sense,  functional fit by 'splinets' to the data consisting of sampled values of an unknown function.
